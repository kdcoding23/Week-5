Promineo Tech's Week 5 Coding Assignment was to create a menu app that meets these requirements:

- Use at least 1 array.
- Use at least 2 classes.
- Meny should have the options to create, view, and delete elements.

I created an app that allows you to create a movie with your dream cast, and view and delete or "fire" actors as well.
